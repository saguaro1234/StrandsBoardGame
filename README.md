# StrandsBoardGame
two player pygame version of the board game strands

Strands is an abstract strategy board game played on a grid of hexagons.
There are two players, one who places black stones and the other who places white. The object of the 
game is to build the largest connected group on the board. On your turn you may play as many stones as 
permitted. The number of stones permitted is determined by the color grid. In this version of the game 
color grid on the board represents the number of stones to be played and is:





green: 6
purple: 4
orange: 3
blue: 2
red: 1

Once a player has placed a stone they may only play on that same color for the rest of their turn, and they
must play as many stones as that color represents. Once they have placed all their stones, it is the next 
players turn. On the first turn of the game, the black player gets to play one stone on any of the blue spaces.
